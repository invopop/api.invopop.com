## What is a Workflow?

A workflow in Invopop is essentially a list of steps that are executed sequentially for an incoming _job_. Each step in a workflow is linked to a provider of a specific service, such as:

- Generating a PDF
- Forwarding invoices to an external tax agency
- Modifying data
- Sending emails
- Posting webhooks
- Forwarding documents to ERPs or other systems

Workflows allow you to automate and streamline processes related to document handling. Invopop handles the complexity of ensuring that every step is executed using retries and error handling.

## How to create a Workflow

While it is possible to create workflows via the API, we recommend using the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) as the UI will help you correctly define and configure the different steps.

From the Invopop Console, these are the steps to follow:

<Steps>

<Step title="Goto the -Workflows- section">
  In the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com), use the sidebar to
  naviate to the _Workflows_ section.
</Step>

<Step title="Tap -New Workflow-">
  You'll be presented with a modal to start creating the new workflow.
</Step>

<Step title="Select document type">
There are currently two document types:

- **Invoice** - sales or expenses.
- **Contact** - suppliers or customers.

Choose **Invoice** for this example.

</Step>
<Step title="Tap -Create Workflow-">
This will save the new workflow and present the empty workflow editor screen.
</Step>

</Steps>

Give your workflow a name for easy identification (e.g., "Process Invoice")
After creating a workflow, you can add specific steps to define the actions that will be performed on the documents processed through that workflow.

Use the Workflow Switcher to swap between the visual and developer workflow editors. The developer editor uses JSON and can be used to easily copy and paste examples from elswhere.

## Running a Workflow

Workflows in Invopop are executed:

- manually via the invopop console,
- via API calls to the [create job endpont](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-put), or,
- automatically by an embedded application.

Before a job can be executed however, you need to [upload the data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) you'll be working with to the "silo" as a "silo entry".

As a job is executed, the silo entry will be updated with any changes or attachments generated during processing.
