## What is a Workflow?

A workflow in Invopop is essentially a list of steps that are executed sequentially for an incoming _job_. Each step in a workflow is linked to a provider of a specific service, such as:

- Generating a PDF.
- Forwarding invoices to an external tax agency.
- Modifying documents.
- Sending emails.
- Posting webhooks.
- Forwarding documents to ERPs or other systems, etc.

Workflows allow you to automate and streamline processes related to document handling. Invopop handles the complexity of ensuring that every step is executed using retries and error handling.

## How to create a Workflow

Although workflows can be created via the API, we recommend using the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com), as its user-friendly interface will help you configure each action available.

<Steps>

<Step title="Go to the workflows section">
  On the sidebar click on `Workflows`.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new workflow">
  You'll be presented with a modal prompting you to select one of our two document types:

  - `Invoices:` sales or expenses.
  - `Contacts:` suppliers or customers.

  For this example, select `Invoices` and click on `Create Workflow`.

</Step>

<Step title="Name your workflow">
  Give your workflow a name for easy identification, like "Process Invoice" by clicking on the **pencil icon** next to the title in the top bar.
</Step>

<Step title="Add your first action">
  Select an action from the sidebar to add it to your workflow. You can add more steps by clicking on the `+` button. Some steps will require configuration in order to function correctly.
</Step>

</Steps>

The "developer mode" switch at the top right can be used to display the workflow as a JSON document. This makes it easy to copy and paste workflows from examples or other workspaces, just make sure to return to the visual editor view to ensure the document is validated.

## Running a Workflow

Workflows in Invopop can be executed in three ways:

- **Manually:** through the invopop console.
- **Via API calls:** using the [create job endpoint](/api-ref/transform/jobs/create-a-job-put).
- **Automatically:** triggered by an embedded application.

Before a job can be executed you need to [upload the data](/api-ref/silo/entries/create-an-entry-put) into the into the <Tooltip tip="The GOBL Envelope storage service">silo</Tooltip> as a silo entry.

As a job is executed, the silo entry will be updated with any changes or attachments generated during processing.

The status of a job can be seen in the silo entry's activity tab, or in the **Workflows** â†’ **History** section accessible from the left sidebar.
