## Introduction

VeriFactu is a fiscal initiative by the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) that requires businesses to report invoices through certified software. The system generates unique identifiers for each invoice and creates digitally signed XML files that are submitted to the tax authorities, helping combat fraud through improved traceability and verification.

While currently optional for businesses in Spain, VeriFactu offers significant advantages for invoice compliance and verification. Invopop seamlessly handles the conversion of GOBL Invoices to VeriFactu format and submission to AEAT systems.

  - Company name
