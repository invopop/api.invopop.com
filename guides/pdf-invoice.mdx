description: How to issue simple PDF invoices globally.
---

## Introduction

The objective of this guide is to take you through the process of generating a simple PDF invoice you can send to your customers. This is valid for tax regimes that don't require any electronic reporting nor invoicing, and serves as a useful example from which to create your own workflows.

Once completed, the workflow will work with any GOBL invoice produced for potentially any country in the world.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following data to be able to issue basic PDF invoices:

- Supplier details - fiscal details of who is issuing.
- Customer details - fiscal details of who is receiving for B2B invoices.
- List of products or services being sold, including quantities and prices.
- Know what taxes and rates apply.
- Have chosen a "series" for the invoice, a few alphanumerical characters to help group invoices together.

## Setup

To be able to issue PDF invoices with Invopop you'll need to create a new workflow with the following steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Add Sequential Code">
This step will assign a code to the invoice automatically. In the step configuration, ensure:

- The _dynamic_ sequence option is selected.
- A name has been assigned.
- The _Sign document_ checkbox is checked.

</Step>

<Step title="Generate PDF">
Perform the actual conversion to PDF and upload the output as an attachment to the Silo Entry.

Make any changes to the configuration that you deem appropriate.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Info>
  See the [workflows guide](/guides/workflows) for details on how to create a
  workflow.

You can also cut and paste the following JSON workflow using the developer mode of the workflow editor:

## Examples

Use the following example GOBL Invoices inside the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) to create new silo entries, before creating jobs on the PDF Invoice workflow you just created.
