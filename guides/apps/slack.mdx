Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. For instance, you might want to receive a message when one of your job executions fails:

In this example, you will receive in your Slack channel "#random" a message like "Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!" when the PDF generation fails.

## How to use

For this explanation, we assume you already have a Slack Workspace created.

1. Navigate to the Apps section in the Invopop console.
2. Find the Slack App and click "Connect".

A new window will open, showing the scopes required by Invopop. After you accept the connection, you will be redirected back to the Invopop console, where you should see a message that says “Authorized and connected to:” followed by the icon and name of your Slack Workspace. This confirms that the connection was successful.

1. Navigate to the Workflows section in the Invopop console.
2. Add the Slack step to your workflow.
