## Related Documents

In the Invopop Console, each document has a `Related` tab. With proper configuration, this tab displays other documents linked to the current document. For example, all invoices linked to a supplier or the invoice a credit note refers to.

The key to linking documents reliably is the UUID field. This optional field is generated by Invopop if left blank. You can use Invopop's UUID or your own internal identifiers.

## UUID Linking

This guide will follow the example of linking a supplier to its invoices.

To begin, you must upload a supplier to Invopop. You can either use your own UUID or leave it blank and Invopop will generate it.

Then, the supplier must be signed for the linked invoice to appear. To do this, send the supplier to a "contacts" workflow with the `Sign Envelope` step. For further information on workflows check the [docs](workflows).

Finally, when creating an invoice you want to link to a supplier, simply add the contact's UUID field to the invoice, just like you would with `name` or `address`. The result is that the invoice will be linked to the supplier, and all invoices with the used supplier will appear on the its `Related` tab.

<Warning>The related document search works in one direction. You will be able to see all invoices linked to a supplier in its `Related` tab, but not the supplier's link in an invoice. </Warning>

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What is a UUID?">
A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier unique across space and time. In Invopop, UUIDs link documents reliably, ensuring each document has a unique reference.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to generate my own UUIDs?">
No. If you don't provide a UUID, Invopop will generate one for you. You can use your own internal identifiers if preferred.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change a document's UUID after creation?">
No. Once a document is created and signed with a UUID, that identifier becomes permanent and cannot be modified.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I use an invalid UUID?">
Since the UUID is optional, providing an invalid format or referencing a non-existent document will result in no link being created.
