## Related Documents

In the Invopop Console, each document has a `Related` tab. With proper configuration, this tab displays all invoices linked to a supplier or the invoice a credit note refers to.

The key to linking documents reliably is the UUID field. This optional field is generated by Invopop if left blank. You can use Invopop's UUID or your own internal identifiers.

## Use Cases

This guide will follow the example of the invoice-supplier link. Once you have uploaded a supplier, with its UUID, you will then need to `sign` the supplier. To do this, send the supplier to a "contacts" workflow with the `Sign Envelope` step. For further information on workflows check the [docs]("guides/worflows").

Then, when creating an invoice, simply add the contact's UUID field to the invoice, just like you would with `name` or `address`.

The result is that the invoice will be linked to the supplier, and all invoices with the used supplier will appear on the supplier's `Related` tab.

## Limitations

The related document search works in one direction. You can see all invoices linked to a supplier in its `Related` tab, but not the supplier's link in an invoice.

## FAQ

### What is a UUID?
A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier unique across space and time. In Invopop, UUIDs link documents reliably, ensuring each document has a unique reference.

### Do I need to generate my own UUIDs?
No. If you don't provide a UUID, Invopop will generate one for you. You can use your own internal identifiers if preferred.

### Can I link multiple documents together?
Yes. A document can link to multiple others through UUIDs. For example, a credit note can reference its original invoice and link to the supplier.

### What happens if I use an invalid UUID?
Since the UUID is optional, providing an invalid format or referencing a non-existent document will result in no link being created.
