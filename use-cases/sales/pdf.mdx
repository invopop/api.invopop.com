description: Guidelines on how to convert GOBL invoices into PDF documents.
---

## Background

PDFs are frequently used for invoicing because they provide a reliable and universally accepted format that preserves the document's layout and content.

At Invopop, PDFs are generated by converting GOBL documents into HTML using the Open Source [gobl.html](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.html) project, which in turn is converted into a PDF document using [Prince](https://www.princexml.com/) under a commercial license.

## Usage

Simply add the "Generate PDF" step to a workflow in the Invopop console or via the API.

The workflow step can be configured with:

- A logo to include in the header of the document. As an alternative, we recommend using the `logos` property of the supplier's [org.Party](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party) object.
- The height of the logo. Anything over 80 is probably too high, but we recommend trial and error to determine what looks best for your use-case.
- Locale for the language. `en` for English is the default.
- Date format. ISO date format (year-month-day) is always recommended.

Due to the complexity of generating invoices in multiple countries, modifying the layout is not possible via configuration, but do get in touch with the Invopop team to see if we can help.

<Tip>
  Test out how your Invoices might look in the [GOBL
  Builder](https://build.gobl.org) by pasting your GOBL document and clicking
  the "print" button for a preview.
