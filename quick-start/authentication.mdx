title: "Authentication"
description: "After completing this quick start guide you'll have generated and tested an authentication token that can be used in all subsequent requests to the Invopop API."

## Create an Account

Head over to the the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com) and follow
the steps to either log in or create an account.

## Get a Token

1. Once inside the console, click **Settings**.

2. Enter the **Tokens** section.

3. Tap the "**New Token**" button.

4. Provide a name for future reference, and any notes perhaps describing a use
   case, then click **Save**.

5. You'll be presented with a new token in text and a button to copy the
   details. Tap the copy button, and paste the token somewhere safe.

<Tip>
  Invopop uses JSON Web Tokens. If you're interested in seeing the contents,
  head over to [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) and paste you're token to see what's
  inside.
</Tip>

## Test

To test our new token, open the Terminal and prepare our environment using the
following command, replacing `<TOKEN>` with the actual token generated from the
Invopop console in the last step:

```bash
export INVOPOP_TOKEN="<TOKEN>"
```

This saves us from copying and pasting the token every time we need to use it,
and we can now make a call to the Invopop Ping service:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $INVOPOP_TOKEN" https://api.invopop.com/utils/v1/ping | jq .
```

Response:

```json
{
  "ping": "pong"
}
```

This ping call doesn't do anything useful, other than ensuring that your
connection and credentials are valid.

<Note>
  Most examples throughout this documentation will assume you have set the
  `$INVOPOP_TOKEN` variable.
</Note>

## Conclusion

You've now managed to authenticate with the Invopop API using a generated token.
