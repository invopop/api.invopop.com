Invopop's SDI Italy provider allows you to generate and issue FatturaPA documents in Italy. This component uses [A-Cube](https://www.acubeapi.com), a local technology provider that Invopop partners with, to submit FatturaPA documents to the Italian tax authority via the Exchange System (SDI).

Please refer to the docs of the [GOBL's Italy Tax Regime](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/blob/main/regimes/it/README.md) to learn about the specifics of Italian GOBL documents and to get examples.

The library that transforms GOBL into FatturaPA documents is also publicly available as an open-source project and can be found at [github.com/invopop/gobl.fatturapa](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.fatturapa).

The guide to walk you through the process of issuing FatturaPA documents in Italy will soon be available. In the meantime, please contact us via Slack or [support@invopop.com](mailto:support@invopop.com) to help you with this.
