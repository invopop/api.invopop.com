Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. With this app, you can set up custom messages to notify your team about job status updates, ensuring everyone stays informed.

## How to use

This guide assumes that you already have a Slack Workspace created.

### 1. Connect to your Slack Workspace

To connect to your Slack Workspace, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Apps section in the Invopop console.
2. Find the Slack App and click "Connect."
3. Click "Configure" and then "Connect with Slack."

A new window will open showing the scopes required by Invopop. After you accept the connection, you will be redirected back to Invopop console where you should see a message that says "Authorized and connected to:" followed by the icon and name of your Slack Workspace. This confirms that the connection was successful.

### 2. Add the Slack step in your workflows

To use the Slack step in your workflows, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Workflows section in the Invopop console.
2. Add the Slack step to your workflow.
3. Select the Slack channel where you want to send messages.
4. Customize the message content as needed.

For example, you can configure a message to be sent to the #random channel if a PDF generation fails. An example message received in Slack might be: "Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!".
