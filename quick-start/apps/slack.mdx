Invopop's Slack app helps you keep your team updated by sending automated messages to a Slack channel of your choice. With this app, you can set up custom messages to notify your team about job status updates, ensuring everyone stays informed.

## How to use

This guide assumes that you already have a Slack Workspace created.

### 1. Connect to your Slack Workspace

First, you need to connect to your Slack Workspace. To do this, just navigate in the console to the apps section, find the Slack App, click "Connect", then "Configure" and, finally, "Connect with Slack".

This will open a new window showing the scopes required by Invopop. After accepting to connect, if everything worked fine, you will see a message that says "Authorized and connected to:", followed by an icon and name of your Slack Workspace. Now you are all set to use the Slack step in your workflows!

### 2. Add the Slack step in your workflows

To use the Slack step, navigate to the workflows section in the Invopop console and add the Slack step to your workflow. Before being able to use it, you need to select a channel you would like to send it and customize the message.

One use case would be receiving a message when a workflow fails or some step throws a KO. In this case, an example of message you could receive is: "Job fe094ad0-3e12-11ef-bfd5-15fe9005edf3 failed!".

For example, you can configure a message to be sent to the #random channel if a PDF generation fails:
