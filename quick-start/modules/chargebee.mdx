The Invopop's Chargebee module allows you to import invoices and credit notes from your Chargebee account and process them with a workflow in Invopop. This lets you automate the transformation, processing and publishing of your Chargebee invoices and credit notes to comply with local regulations, and integrate with other systems and apps.

## How to set up

To set up the Chagebee module, please follow the following steps:

### 1. Prepare your Chargebee account

First, you need to have a Chargebee account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/). Your account must be properly configured to generate invoices and credit notes in the country where you operate. Please, refer to the Chargebee documentation for more information on how to configure your account.

In order to generate e-invoices in certain local formats, you may need to configure custom fields in some of your Chargebee objects (typically, subscriptions and customers). You can do this in the Chargebee dashboard under Settings > Configure Chargebee > Custom Fields. Please, contact Invopop support for additional guidance on which fields you need to configure in the tax regimes where you operate.

Also, your Chargebee account must have the API access enabled. You can enable the API access in the Chargebee dashboard under Settings > Configure Chargebee > API Keys.

### 2. Enter the supplier details

Now you have to provide the details of the supplier that will appear in the invoices and credit notes generated by the Chargebee module. To do this, go to the Contacts > Suppliers section in the Invopop console and create a new supplier with the details (name, tax ID, addressâ€¦) of the company issuing the invoices. Depending on the tax regime, the required data may vary. Please, contact Invopop support if you need additional guidance.

### 3. Prepare a workflow

Next, you need to create a workflow in Invopop to process the invoices and credit notes imported from Chargebee. You can create a new workflow going to Configure > Workflows in the Invopop console.

The workflow should include the steps to transform the imported invoices and credit notes into the format required by the local regulations, and to publish them to the destination system or app. You can also add steps for any additional automation you wish to apply to the invoices and credit notes, like sending notifications, updating other systems, etc.

Make sure you add the Chargebee step at the end of the workflow that will notify back to Chargebee the processing of the invoice or credit note.

### 4. Connect the Chargebee module

Finally, you have to connect and configure the Chargebee module itself. You can do that by going to Configure > Modules in the Invopop console. There you will be able to "Connect" and "Configure" the Chargebee module by providing the site and the API key of your Chargebee account, and selecting the supplier and workflow you prepared in the previous steps.

## How to use

Once [the module setup](#how-to-set-up) is completed, you can go to Modules > Chargebee in the Invopop console to trigger the sync process that will import and process any newly generated invoice and credit note from your Chargebee account.

As part of the the syncing process, the Chargebee module will post comments in the invoices and credit notes in Chargebee to notify the status, notify errors and link to generated files.
