title: "Authentication"
description: To get started using the Invopop API, you'll need to generate an access token for the "company" you'll be working with.
---

Currently, tokens are generated using the [Invopop Console](https://console.invopop.com). Enter "Settings", then "Tokens",
and tap "New Token". Enter some reference details and click "Save". You'll be
presented with a screen showing the new token. You **must** copy and paste this
token, as we do not store it anywhere. If you loose it, you'll need to create a
new one.

Tokens must be included in the `Authentication` HTTP header in all requests as a
type `Bearer`.

Test everything is working correctly using the [ping](/reference/utils/ping)
endpoint and curl:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authentication: Bearer " https://api.invopop.com/utils/v1/ping
{"ping":"pong"}
```
