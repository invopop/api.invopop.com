The invopop API is split into multiple services. Each is effectively a namespace
for the different problem domain that we're trying to provide solutions for.

The current list of key services is:

- [Utils](/utils/ping)

  - a simple ping/pong endpoint used for testing.

- [Sequences](/reference/sequences/introduction)

  - providing reliable and scalable support for generating sequential codes.

- [Transform](/reference/transform/introduction)

  - responsible for handling workflow and connector definitions, alongside
    support for enqueueing "jobs".

- [Silo](/reference/silo/introduction)
  - our name for GOBL Envelope and attachment long-term storage.

We go into detail of each of these services in the upcoming sections.
