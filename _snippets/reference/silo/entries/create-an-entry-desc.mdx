The <code>data</code> field may contain either GOBL Envelope or Object, and
will be validated before being persisted.

New entries may also be created based on a previous entry using the

<code>previous_id</code> field. Using a previous entry allows you to provide patch
data instead of a new full document by setting the patch type in the <code>
  content_type
</code> field to either:

- <code>application/json-patch+json</code> - for JSON Patch (RFC 6902)
- <code>application/merge-patch+json</code> - for JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)

The <code>previous_id</code> field can also be used to make corrective documents
by adding the corrective option data in the <code>correct</code> field. For more
details on this, see the <a href="https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/bill/correction_options">GOBL documentation
for correction options</a>.
